"Odoo is very flexible on the subject of security. We can control what "
"users can do and what they cannot on different levels. Also we can "
"control independently each of the four basic operations: read, write, "
"create, unlink. I.e. allow only read, allow only create, grant permission"
" to create or delete only."
