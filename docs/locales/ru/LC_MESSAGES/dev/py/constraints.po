"A Python constraint is defined as a method decorated with "
"`~openerp.api.constrains`, and invoked on a recordset. The decorator "
"specifies which fields are involved in the constraint, so that the "
"constraint is automatically evaluated when one of them is modified. The "
"method is expected to raise an exception if its invariant is not "
"satisfied::"

"SQL constraints are defined through the model attribute "
"`~openerp.models.Model._sql_constraints`. The latter is assigned to a "
"list of triples of strings ``(name, sql_definition, message)``, where "
"``name`` is a valid SQL constraint name, ``sql_definition`` is a "
"``table_constraint_`` expression, and ``message`` is the error message."
