"And api.model is considered to be used when you need to do something with"
" model itself and don't need to modify/check some exact model's "
"record/records. For example there could be method that returns some meta "
"info about model's structure or some helper methods, etc. Also in "
"documentation it is said that this api is good to use when migrating from"
" old api, because it \"politely\" converts code to new api. Also in my "
"own experience, if you need method to return something, model decorator "
"is good for it. api.one returns empty list, so it might lead to "
"unexpected behavior when using api.one on method when it is supposed to "
"return something."
