"Web applications were originally developed around a client/server model, "
"where the Web client is always the initiator of transactions, requesting "
"data from the server. Thus, there was no mechanism for the server to "
"independently send, or push, data to the client without the client first "
"making a request."

#: ../../admin/about_longpolling.rst:12
msgid ""
"To overcome this deficiency, Web app developers can implement a technique"
" called HTTP long polling, where the client polls the server requesting "
"new information.  The server holds the request open until new data is "
"available. Once available, the server responds and sends the new "
"information. When the client receives the new information, it immediately"
" sends another request, and the operation is repeated. This effectively "
"emulates a server push feature."

msgstr ""

#: ../../admin/db_maxconn.rst:120
msgid ""
"For multi-processing mode, each HTTP worker handles a single request at a"
" time, so theoretically ``db_maxconn=2`` could work (some requests need 2"
" cursors, hence 2 db connections). However for multi-tenant this is not "
"optimal because each request will need to reopen a new connection to a "
"different db - setting it a bit higher is better. With lots of workers, "
"32 is a good trade-off, as 64 could make you reach kernel limits. Also "
"keep in mind that the limit applies to the longpolling worker too, and "
"you don't want to delay chat messages too much because of a full "
"connection pool, so don't set it too low no matter what. Keeping the "
"value in the 32-64 range usually seems a good choice."
msgstr ""

"For multi-thread mode, since there is only 1 process, this is the size of"
" the global connection pool. To prevent errors, it should be set between "
"1x and 2x the expected number of concurrent requests at a time. Can be "
"estimated based on the number of databases and the expected activity. "
"Having a single process handle more than 20 request at a time on a single"
" core (remember that multi-thread depends on the GIL) is unlikely to give"
" good performance, so again, a setting in the 32-64 range will most "
"likely work for a normal load."

"(Raspbian automatically provides one for ``/tmp``). These ramdisks are "
"setup by ``setup_ramdisks.sh``, which we run before all other init "
"scripts by running it in ``/etc/init.d/rcS``. The ramdisks are named "
"``/etc_ram`` and ``/var_ram`` respectively. Most data from ``/etc`` and "
"``/var`` is copied to these tmpfs ramdisks. In order to restrict the size"
" of the ramdisks, we do not copy over certain things to them (eg. apt "
"related data). We then bind mount them over the original directories. So "
"when an application writes to ``/etc/foo/bar`` it's actually writing to "
"``/etc_ram/foo/bar``. We also bind mount ``/`` to "
"``/root_bypass_ramdisks`` to be able to get to the real ``/etc`` and "

"So the documentation states that a single worker can handle 6 users. What"
" it means to say is that a worker can handle on average ~ 6 heavy read "
"transactions / second (150ms each) = 6 web requests/s. If a user triggers"
" about 60 heavy requests / minute during active use, that's 1 req/s on "
"average, so 6 users could max out a worker during peaks, when all of them"
" are active. But in reality humans don't create sustained load, and the "
"real usage will average out over time to a much lower number, maybe 20% "
"of that, so a single worker may be able to handle dozens of normal users."
" Unless you're facing pathological cases, like a class where all students"
" click at the same time, or heavy automated RPC scripts (non-human heavy "
"users), you could start with 1 worker for 30 users, maybe even 40 in a "
