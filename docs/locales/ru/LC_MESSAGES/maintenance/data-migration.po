"This class manage the migration of modules. Migrations files must be "
"python files containing a ``migrate(cr, installed_version)`` function. "
"Theses files must respect a directory tree structure: A 'migrations' "
"folder which contains a folder by version. Version can be 'module' "
"version or 'server.module' version (in this case, the files will only be "
"processed by this version of the server). Python file names must start by"
" *pre* or *post* and will be executed, respectively, before and after the"
" module initialisation. *end* scripts are run after all modules have been"
" updated."

"Migration files are just code files that don't need to be registered "
"anywhere. When updating an addon Odoo searching in the *migrations* for "
"folders with a version in between, up to, and including the version that "
"is in updating for. It happens before all other files were observed, so "
"at this moment nothing is changed at your database layout. Then, if "
"folders are found Odoo executes python files with prefix *pre-* in it. "
"They should contain a defined function called migrate. This function has "
"two arguments: database cursor and currently installed version."

"After all pre-migrate functions were successfully executed, Odoo updates "
"the module. Now, the database might be different from the previous "
"version one. For example, if in a new version we changed the model field "
"type, in the database this column will be changed without data "
"preserving. Or if a field was renamed, in the new version just a new "
"column will be created."
