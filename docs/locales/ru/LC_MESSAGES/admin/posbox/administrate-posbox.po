"The **POSBox** runs a heavily modified **Raspbian Linux** installation, a"
" Debian derivative for the **Raspberry Pi**. It also runs a barebones "
"installation of Odoo which provides the webserver and the drivers. The "
"hardware drivers are implemented as Odoo modules. Those modules are all "
"prefixed with ``hw_*`` and they are the only modules that are running on "
"the POSBox. Odoo is only used for the framework it provides. No business "
"data is processed or stored on the POSBox. The Odoo instance is a shallow"
" git clone of the ``8.0`` branch."

"The root partition on the POSBox is mounted ``read-only``, ensuring that "
"we don't wear out the SD card by writing to it too much. It also ensures "
"that the filesystem cannot be corrupted by cutting the power to the "
"POSBox. Linux applications expect to be able to write to certain "
"directories though. So we provide a ramdisk for ``/etc`` and ``/var`` "
"(Raspbian automatically provides one for ``/tmp``). These ramdisks are "
"setup by ``setup_ramdisks.sh``, which we run before all other init "
"scripts by running it in ``/etc/init.d/rcS``. The ramdisks are named "
"``/etc_ram`` and ``/var_ram`` respectively. Most data from ``/etc`` and "
"``/var`` is copied to these tmpfs ramdisks. In order to restrict the size"
" of the ramdisks, we do not copy over certain things to them (eg. apt "
"related data). We then bind mount them over the original directories. So "
"when an application writes to ``/etc/foo/bar`` it's actually writing to "
"``/etc_ram/foo/bar``. We also bind mount ``/`` to "
"``/root_bypass_ramdisks`` to be able to get to the real ``/etc`` and "
"``/var`` during development."
