"Web applications were originally developed around a client/server model, "
"where the Web client is always the initiator of transactions, requesting "
"data from the server. Thus, there was no mechanism for the server to "
"independently send, or push, data to the client without the client first "
"making a request."

"To overcome this deficiency, Web app developers can implement a technique"
" called HTTP long polling, where the client polls the server requesting "
"new information.  The server holds the request open until new data is "
"available. Once available, the server responds and sends the new "
"information. When the client receives the new information, it immediately"
" sends another request, and the operation is repeated. This effectively "
"emulates a server push feature."
